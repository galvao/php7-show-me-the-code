# php7-show-me-the-code
This repository is a "companion" to my ["PHP7: Show me the code!" talk](https://speakerdeck.com/galvao/php7-show-me-the-code). 

Here you'll find source code and [carbon.now.sh](http://carbon.now.sh) samples for what I consider to be the main new features happening in PHP 7.x
The source code provides additional information in the form of comments and links.
